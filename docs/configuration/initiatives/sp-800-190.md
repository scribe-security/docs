# NIST Application Container Security Initiative  
**Type:** Initiative  
**ID:** `SP-800-190`  
**Version:** `1.0.0`  
**Bundle-Version:** `v2`  
**Source:** [v2/initiatives/sp-800-190.yaml](https://github.com/scribe-public/sample-policies/blob/main/v2/initiatives/sp-800-190.yaml)  
**Help:** https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-190/final  

This initiative enforces container security controls as outlined in  NIST SP 800-190. It ensures that containerized applications follow  security best practices, including vulnerability scanning, trusted  image sources, registry security, and proper configuration to minimize risk. The initiative enables policy-driven enforcement of security controls  throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), providing real-time  feedback to developers and enforcement in CI/CD pipelines.

## Evidence Requirements

This initiative requires the following evidence types:

- [SBOM](/docs/valint/sbom)
- [Image SBOM](/docs/valint/sbom)
- [SARIF Evidence](/docs/valint/sarif)

## Evidence Defaults

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| signed | False |

## Controls Overview

| Control Name | Control Description | Mitigation |
|--------------|---------------------|------------|
| [[4.1]  IMAGE COUNTERMEASURES](#41-41-image-countermeasures) | Implements security controls to reduce risks associated with  container images, such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,  and unauthorized images. The policies enforce CVE scanning,  mandatory security settings, and allow only trusted sources. | Ensures that all container images meet organizational security  policies before deployment. Helps reduce the attack surface by  blocking images with vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or  unauthorized sources. |
| [[4.2]  REGISTRY COUNTERMEASURES](#42-42-registry-countermeasures) | Implements controls to secure container image registries by enforcing  HTTPS connections, verifying image freshness, and preventing stale  images from being used. | Reduces risks associated with registry security, stale images,  and unauthorized image pulls. Ensures that images are kept up-to-date  and only retrieved from secure sources. |

# Detailed Controls

## [4.1] 4.1 IMAGE COUNTERMEASURES

Implements security controls to reduce risks associated with  container images, such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,  and unauthorized images. The policies enforce CVE scanning,  mandatory security settings, and allow only trusted sources.


### Mitigation  
Ensures that all container images meet organizational security  policies before deployment. Helps reduce the attack surface by  blocking images with vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or  unauthorized sources.

### Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| [4.1.1-trivy-verify-vulnerability-findings](rules/sarif/trivy/verify-cve-severity.md) | [4.1.1 Severity-Based Vulnerabilities](rules/sarif/trivy/verify-cve-severity.md) | Ensures that images do not contain high-severity vulnerabilities. Blocks images if any CVEs exceed the defined severity threshold. |
