## Quickstart: Uploading Evidence
Use our CLI tool to upload your report for analysis and cataloging.

 Install CLI 

Get the `valint` tool

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.scribesecurity.com/install.sh  | sh -s -- -t valint
```
Upload the report as evidence:

```bash
valint evidence [path] --parser <parser name> [-o attest]
```
- Use `-o attest`  if you want the report to be signed.
- Use `--parser`  to select one of the [﻿supported parsers](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/valint/help/valint_evidence#examples-for-running-valint-evidence) .
>  For more detailed options, see the [﻿valint documentation](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/valint/generic).
