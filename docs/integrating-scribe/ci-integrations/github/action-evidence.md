Scribe offers the use of GitHub Actions to enable the embedding of evidence collection and integrity validation into your pipeline as a way to help secure your software supply chain.

`valint evidence` is used to collect, Create and Store any file as evidence.

Further documentation **[GitHub integration](../../../integrating-scribe/ci-integrations/github)**.

### Evidence Action
The `valint evidence` action is a versatile action designed to include various types of third-party evidence in your software supply chain. It supports the inclusion of evidence in different formats and can be tailored to fit your specific use cases.

- **Custom Third-Party Evidence:** Attach any third-party evidence.
- **Custom Third-Party CylconeDX:** Attach and third-party SBOM to your product.
- **Flexible Storage:** Store and manage evidence on the Scribe service.
- **OCI Registry Integration:** Attach evidence to any OCI registry or generate evidence directly from your private OCI registry.
- **Licensing Information:** Include any licencing report as part as evidence.
- **Customization Options:** Customize Tool and Format information.
- **Signing SBOM Support:** Attach and sign any third party SBOMs as evidence.
- **Signing Sarif Support:** Attach and sign any third party Sarif as evidence.
- **Signing Capabilities:** Generate In-Toto Attestations out of any file, enhanced security.
- **Keyless Verification:** Support Sigstore keyless verifying as well as [GitHub workload identity](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).

> Note: Containerized actions may have limitations on generating evidence for targets located outside the working directory. To overcome this, consider installing the tool directly using the [installer](https://github.com/scribe-security/actions/tree/master/installer).

- name: Include evidence derived from a file
  uses: scribe-security/action-evidence@v1.5.18
  with:
    target: some_file.json
```

Composite Action can be used on Linux or Windows runners as following
```yaml

  with:
    target: some_file.json
```

> Use `master` instead of tag to automatically pull latest version.


### 1. Obtain a Scribe Hub API Token
1. Sign in to [Scribe Hub](https://app.scribesecurity.com). If you don't have an account you can sign up for free [here](https://scribesecurity.com/scribe-platform-lp/ "Start Using Scribe For Free").

2. Create a API token in [Scribe Hub > Settings > Tokens](https://app.scribesecurity.com/settings/tokens). Copy it to a safe temporary notepad until you complete the integration.

:::note Important
The token is a secret and will not be accessible from the UI after you finalize the token generation. 
:::

### 2. Add the API token to GitLab secrets

Set your Scribe Hub API token in Github with a key named SCRIBE_TOKEN as instructed in *GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets/ "GitHub Instructions")

### 3. Instrument your build scripts

#### Usage

```yaml
name:  scribe_github_workflow

on: 
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"

jobs:
  scribe-sign-verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: scribe-security/action-evidence@master
        with:
          target: [file]
          format: [attest, statement]
          scribe-client-secret: ${{ secrets.SCRIBE_TOKEN }}

      - uses: scribe-security/action-verify@master
        with:
          target: [target]
          input-format: [attest-generic, statement-generic]
          scribe-client-secret: ${{ secrets.SCRIBE_TOKEN }}
```

### Configuration
If you prefer using a custom configuration file instead of specifying arguments directly, you have two choices. You can either place the configuration file in the default path, which is `.valint.yaml`, or you can specify a custom path using the `config` argument.

For a comprehensive overview of the configuration file's structure and available options, please refer to the CLI configuration documentation.

### Attestations 
Attestations allow you to sign and verify your targets. <br />
Attestations allow you to connect PKI-based identities to your evidence and policy management.  <br />

Supported outputs:
- In-toto statements (unsigned evidence).
- In-toto attestations (signed evidence).

Select default configuration using `--attest.default` flag. <br />
Select a custom configuration by providing `cocosign` field in the **[configuration](../configuration)** or custom path using `--attest.config`.
Scribe uses the **cocosign** library we developed to deal with digital signatures signing and verification.

* See details of in-toto spec **[here](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation)**.
* See details of what attestations are and how to use them **[here](../attestations)**.

>By default GitHub actions use `sigstore-github` flow, GitHub provided workload identities, this will allow using the workflow identity (`token-id` permissions is required).


### Storing Keys in Secret Vault

GitHub exposes secrets from its vault using environment variables, you may provide these environment as secret to Valint.

> Paths names prefixed with `env://[NAME]` are read from the environment matching the name.

<details>
  <summary> GitHub Secret Vault </summary>

X509 Signer enables the utilization of environments for supplying key, certificate, and CA files in order to sign and verify attestations. It is commonly employed in conjunction with Secret Vaults, where secrets are exposed through environments.

>  path names prefixed with `env://[NAME]` are extracted from the environment corresponding to the specified name.


For example the following configuration and Job.

Configuration File, `.valint.yaml`
```yaml
attest:
  default: "" # Set custom configuration
  cocosign:
    signer:
        x509:
            enable: true
            private: env://SIGNER_KEY
            cert: env://SIGNER_CERT
            ca: env://COMPANY_CA
    verifier:
        x509:
            enable: true
            cert: env://SIGNER_CERT
            ca: env://COMPANY_CA
```
Job example
```yaml
name:  github_vault_workflow

on: 
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"

jobs:
  scribe-sign-verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        uses: scribe-security/action-evidence@master
        with:
          target: some_file.json
          format: attest
        env:
          SIGNER_KEY: ${{ secrets.SIGNER_KEY }}
          SIGNER_CERT: ${{ secrets.SIGNER_CERT }}
          COMPANY_CA:  ${{ secrets.COMPANY_CA }}

        uses: scribe-security/action-verify@master
        with:
          target: some_file.json
          input-format: attest
        env:
          SIGNER_CERT: ${{ secrets.SIGNER_CERT }}
          COMPANY_CA:  ${{ secrets.COMPANY_CA }}
```

</details>

### Running action as non root user
By default, the action runs in its own pid namespace as the root user. You can change the user by setting specific `USERID` and `USERNAME` environment variables.

```YAML
- name: Include evidence step
  uses: scribe-security/action-evidence@master
  with:
    target: 'some_file.json'
  env:
    USERID: 1001
    USERNAME: runner
``` 

<details>
  <summary> Non root user with HIGH UID/GID </summary>
By default, the action runs in its own pid namespace as the root user. If the user uses a high UID or GID, you must specify all the following environment variables. You can change the user by setting specific `USERID` and `USERNAME` variables. Additionally, you may group the process by setting specific `GROUPID` and `GROUP` variables.

```YAML
- name: Include evidence step
  uses: scribe-security/action-evidence@master
  with:
    target: 'some_file.json'
  env:
    USERID: 888000888
    USERNAME: my_user
    GROUPID: 777000777
    GROUP: my_group
``` 
</details>

### Basic examples

### Alternative evidence stores

> You can learn more about alternative stores **[here](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/integrating-scribe/other-evidence-stores)**.

<details>
  <summary> Alternative store OCI </summary>

Valint supports both storage and verification flows for `attestations` and `statement` objects utilizing OCI registry as an evidence store.

Using OCI registry as an evidence store allows you to upload, download and verify evidence across your supply chain in a seamless manner.

Related flags:
* `oci` Enable OCI store.
* `oci-repo` - Evidence store location.

### Before you begin

Evidence can be stored in any accusable registry.
* Write access is required for upload (generate).
* Read access is required for download (verify).

You must first login with the required access privileges to your registry before calling Valint.
For example, using `docker login` command or `docker/login-action` action.

### Usage

```yaml
name:  scribe_github_workflow

on: 
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"
