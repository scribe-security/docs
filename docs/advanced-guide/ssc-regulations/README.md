title: SSC Regulations
Following the famous SolarWinds attack the US has created several frameworks of best practices and regulations to improve software supply chain security.

Scribe ascribes to two of the main ones - NIST's [﻿SSDF (SP 800-218)](https://scribesecurity.com/blog/ssdf-nist-800-218-final-version-differences-from-the-draft-and-their-implications-for-you/) and OpenSSF's [﻿SLSA framework](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2). 

The SSDF provides a wide range of guidelines meant to be used by any software producer to improve its software supply chain security.

The SLSA framework, unlike the SSDF, is more of a checklist of requirements organized into 4 tiers, each more strict than its predecessors. 

You can read more about the policies defined by Scribe to represent these frameworks as policies that can be verified on your builds on the following pages:

- [﻿SSDF policies](ssdfpolicies) 
- [﻿SLSA policies](slsapolicies)
