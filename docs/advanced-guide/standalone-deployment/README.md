If you are planning to deploy in this mode, you should [﻿reach out to us](https://scribesecurity.com/contact-us/) to discuss a custom license.

In a local deployment, Valint generates SBOMs, collects additional evidence, and uses a filesystem folder or an OCI registry that you provide as a storage place for this evidence. When evaluating a policy, Valint retrieves the necessary evidence from this designated evidence store.

You can store the Provenance Document in alternative evidence stores. You can learn more about them [﻿here](../../integrating-scribe/other-evidence-stores).
