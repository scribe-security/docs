# Complying with security standards

Scribe can help assess your compliance gaps for every software build run. To assess these gaps, you must first [connect Scribe to your SCM](../../../how-to-run-scribe/ci-integrations/github#connecting-scribeapp-to-your-organizational-github-account) and your [CI platform](../../../how-to-run-scribe/ci-integrations/).

Scribe can help you assess your compliance to [NIST's SSDF](../../../ssc-regulations/ssdfpolicies) and to the [SLSA framework](../../../ssc-regulations/slsapolicies) up to level 3.
