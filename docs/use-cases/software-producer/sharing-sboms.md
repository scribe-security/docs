You can share SBOMs of versions that you publish with stakeholders such as consumers of the software you build.
Go to **Products** catalog and find the relevant product card click ‘Invite Subscribers’ and input the email addresses of the stakeholders.

Next click the card and select the specific version that you wish to share and click publish in its rightmost column. Note that at this point you need to manually publish every version explicitly.
