# Managing your products

You can manage security related evidence, such as SBOMs, of software products you build or from 3rd party through the Products catalog. Take a minute to explore the Demo Product in your Scribe account to review the different reports available for your productsâ€™s vulnerabilities, compliance with supply chain security standards, SBOMs, and contextual metadata.

To quickly start collecting evidence from your own products, connect Scribe Hub to your container registry API to generate SBOMs of container images, or you can go for deeper evidence of products you build when you [install the Scribe Valint plugin in your CI system](../../how-to-run-scribe/ci-integrations/).  


Once evidence is collected you can drill down to the reports by selecting the relevant product card in the catalog or search for relevant builds using a rich set of filters.
