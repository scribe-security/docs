# Scribe Hub Reports

The first page you see when you log into your **[Scribe Hub](https://prod.hub.scribesecurity.com/ "Scribe Hub Link")** is your **products** page.

Clicking on a product would lead you to the Builds page for the product and clicking on a Build would lead you to the build dashboard.

The dashboard is your main access to see this build's reports. You can see a summary of the build's compliance information to each of the frameworks, you can see a summary of the vulnerability information, and you can see the integrity validation information.

Here are the reports you can access about your build, your project, and all your projects combined:

* [Compliance Report](compliance)
* [Vulnerabilities Report](vulnerabilities)
* [SBOM Report](sbom)
* [Licenses Report](licenses)
* [Context Report](context)
* [Evidence Page](evidence)
* [Investigation Page](investigation)
