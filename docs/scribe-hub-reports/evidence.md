The evidence report shows all the evidence you have collected and uploaded to Scribe Hub from all your pipelines and projects. 

To reach the evidence report go to the **Evidence** tag on the left.

![Evidence Report](../../img/start/evidence-start.jpg "")

You can search and drill down by timestamp or project to find the evidence set of a specific project or build run.

If you want to know if you have uploaded a particular piece of evidence to be able to call it and use it later in a policy you can check here to see if it's been uploaded successfully.
