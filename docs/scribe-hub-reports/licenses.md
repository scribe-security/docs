A product's build license report shows you all the licenses used by packages in the build built at the end of the pipeline. 

To reach the license report go to **Products > {Your Product} > {Version} > Licenses**.

![Your Licenses Report](../../img/start/license-start.jpg "")

As some licenses are only permissive to open-source projects it's important to verify that all licenses used by your project meet the approval of your legal team.
