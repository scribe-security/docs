title: Scribe Hub Reports
The first page you see when you log into your [﻿Scribe Hub](https://scribehub.scribesecurity.com/) is your **products** page.

Clicking on a product would lead you to the Builds page for the product and clicking on a Build would lead you to the build dashboard.

![Product build dashboard page](../../img/start/dashboard-start.jpg "")

The dashboard is your main access to see this build's reports. You can see a summary of the build's compliance information to each of the frameworks, you can see a summary of the vulnerability information, and you can see the integrity validation information.

Here are the reports you can access about your build, your product, and all your products combined:

- [﻿Products Page](product) 
- [﻿Compliance Report](compliance) 
- [﻿Vulnerabilities Report](vulnerabilities) 
- [﻿Advisories Report](advisories) 
- [﻿SBOM Report](sbom) 
- [﻿Licenses Report](licenses) 
- [﻿Context Report](context) 
- [﻿Investigation Page](investigation)
