The [﻿Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) version 1.1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final) provides recommendations for mitigating the risk of software vulnerabilities. The SSDF practices are organized into four groups. 

Scribe can help achieve two of them:

1. **Protect the Software (PS):** Protect all components of the software from tampering and unauthorized access - relevant to Scribe’s attestation and policy capability.
2. **Produce Well-Secured Software (PW):** Produce well-secured software with minimal security vulnerabilities in its releases - relevant to Scribe’s evidence enrichment and analytics.
Read about how you can evaluate your posture against SSDF [﻿here](ssdfpolicies).
