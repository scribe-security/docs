# CI Integration

Scribe allows you to integrate our *SBOM* creation tool directly into your pipeline so that they may be viewed and shared directly from Scribe Hub. Below are two suggested integrations, using <a href='/docs/ci-integrations/github'>GitHub actions</a> and <a href='/docs/ci-integrations/jenkins'>Jenkins over Kubernetes</a>. We also offer a more generalized option allowing integration with other <a href='/docs/ci-integrations/general'>CI systems</a>.  

No matter the pipeline, the basic operation is the same: You need to create two *SBOMs*, one of the repository files and one of the final image using gensbom. The important part is to include the project key generated by Scribe Hub in the code to create the connection between the generated *SBOM* and Scribe Hub.
