<!-- # Introducing Scribe -->

### What is Scribe?

Scribe is a software supply chain security platform. It serves software producers (DevSecOps, AppSec, and dev teams in either software vendor organizations or in SaaS organizations) and software consumers (buyers, compliance officers, and security operators) to produce the evidence and policies necessary for managing risk in their supply chain. With Scribe, you can attest to your product security, manage SBOMs, and comply with regulations such as NIST’s SSDF and standards such as SLSA. 

### Scribe’s approach

Scribe collects and analyzes evidence on a continuous basis from the software development and build process that attests the software was built securely. For example, this evidence is used to assure code integrity, due code review before build, security testing, use of only allowed dependencies, and commits only by authorize developers. Scribe serves as a hub between software producers and software consumers for sharing this evidence to attest to the security of software products. Lastly, both producers and consumers, can manage their risk by enforcing Scribe policies over the evidence collected.
